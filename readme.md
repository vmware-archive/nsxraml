# NSX for vSphere RAML

This repository holds a RAML specification of the NSX for vSphere 6.x API.
For more details on RAML, please visit http://raml.org.

This RAML file has been generated from information that can be found in the "NSX vSphere API Guide" documentation that is  available in PDF format at vmware.com.

The purpose of this package is to be used as the basis in building dynamic API clients for the NSX for vSphere API and for the automatic generation of API documentation.

An example of one such dynamic client that uses the NSX RAML specification is the Python 'nsxramlclient' that can be found at:
http://github.com/vmware/nsxramlclient

In addition to the RAML file itself, several artifacts are provided that are generated by the tools raml2html, raml2md, raml-fleece and raml2postman:
- In /html-version/ there is a dynamic HTML file generated by raml2html that can be viewed in a browser. There is also a static HTML file generated by raml-fleece that can be converted to a single page PDF documentation file.
- Likewise, /md-version/ contains a markdown file generated by raml2md.
- Finally, in /postman-collection/ there are postman collection and postman environments files generated by raml2postman

You can find more information on the raml2html and raml2md tools on Kevin Renkser's Github

Details on raml2postman can be found on postmanlabs github

# Building

If you are interested in building the artifacts you will need a modified version of raml2html and raml2postman. To install these globally use the following commands:

    npm install -g https://github.com/yfauser/raml2html

    npm install -g https://github.com/yfauser/raml2postman

*Note that if you want a local install do not supply the -g argument.*

You will also need to install some additional packages. To install it globally use the following commands:

    npm install -g janrain/raml-fleece
    npm install -g raml2md

In some systems you may also have to manually install the following:

    npm install -g commander
    npm install -g node-uuid
    npm install -g postman_validator
    npm install -g raml-parser
    npm install -g lodash
    npm install -g async

Once the pre-requisites packages are installed you can run the following script:

    create_artifacts.sh

# Branching and Release

Each major or minor release train of NSX for vSphere in a major.minor.patch versioning scheme will be a branch in this project. These are considered stable for that release train. Example: 6.3 will be a branch.

For each generally available (GA) release of the NSX for vSphere platform there will be a GitHub release (tag) of this project that is named to match the GA version of NSX for vSphere using the major.minor.patch (e.g. 6.2.7) numbering system.

The master branch is considered the development branch for new updates and features. It may or may not be stable.

# Support Lifecycle

The supported versions of this project match the supported versions of the NSX for vSphere platform. For specific dates please see the VMware Lifecycle Product Matrix here:
