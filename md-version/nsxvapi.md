# VMware NSX Data Center for vSphere API documentation version 6.4
https://{nsxmanager}/api

### Introduction
This manual, the *NSX API Guide*, describes how to install, configure, monitor, and maintain the
VMware NSX® Data Center for vSphere® system by using REST API requests.

**Important**: NSX for vSphere is now known as NSX Data Center for vSphere.

## Intended Audience

This manual is intended for anyone who wants to use the REST API to
programmatically control an NSX Data Center for vSphere environment. The information
in this manual is written for experienced developers who are familiar with
virtual machine technology, virtualized datacenter operations, and REST APIs.
This manual also assumes familiarity with NSX Data Center for vSphere.

## Using the NSX REST API

To use the NSX REST API, you must configure a REST client, verify the required
ports are open between your REST client and the NSX Manager, and understand
the general RESTful workflow.

### Ports Required for the NSX REST API

The NSX Manager requires port 443/TCP for REST API requests.

### Configuring REST Clients for the NSX REST API

Some common REST clients include Postman, RESTClient (a Firefox add-on), and
curl (a command-line tool). The details of REST client configuration will vary
from client to client, but this general information should help you configure
your REST client correctly.

* **The NSX REST API can use basic authentication or JSON Web Token authentication.**   
You can authenticate using basic authentication or JSON Web Tokens. See "Working
with API Tokens" for information on creating and using JSON Web Tokens. You must
configure your REST client to send the NSX Manager authentication credentials.
See the documentation for your REST client for details. 

* **You must use https to send API requests to the NSX Manager.**   
You might need to import the certificate from the NSX Manager to your REST
client to allow it to connect to the NSX Manager.

* **When you submit an API request with a request body, you must include the 
appropriate `Content-Type` header.**   
Starting in NSX 6.4, both XML and JSON are supported. This guide documents XML
examples. Set the **Content-Type** header to *application/xml* or *application/json* as needed.  
Some requests require additional headers, for example, firewall configuration
changes require the **If-Match** header. This is noted on each method
description.
* **To ensure you always receive the correct response bodies, set the `Accept` header**   
Starting in NSX 6.4, both XML and JSON are supported. This guide documents XML
examples. Set the **Accept** header to *application/xml* or *application/json* as
needed.  
**Note:** Some methods, for example, the central CLI method, `POST /1.0/nsx/cli`, might require a different Accept header.

The following API method will return a response on a newly deployed NSX
Manager appliance, even if you have not made any configuration changes. You
can use this as a test to verify that your REST client is configured correctly
to communicate with the NSX Manager API.

```
GET /api/2.0/services/usermgmt/user/admin
```

### URI and Query Parameters

Some methods have URI or query parameters. URI parameters are values that you
include in the request URL. You use a question mark (**?**) to join the request
URL and the query parameters. Multiple query parameters can be combined by
using ampersands (**&**).

For example, you can use this method to get a list of logical switches on a transport zone: 

```
GET /api/2.0/vdn/scopes/{scopeId}/virtualwires
```

**scopeId** is a URI parameter that represents a transport zone.

The **startindex** and **pagesize** query parameters control how this
information is displayed. **startindex** determines which logical switch to
begin the list with, and **pagesize** determines how many logical switches to
list.  

To view the first 20 logical switches on transport zone vdnscope-1, use the following parameters:

* **scopeId** URI parameter set to *vdnscope-1*.  
* **startindex** query parameter set to *0*.   
* **pagesize** query parameter set to *20*.   

These parameters are combined to create this request:

```
GET https://192.168.110.42/api/2.0/vdn/scopes/vdnscope-1/virtualwires?
startindex=0&pagesize=20
```

### RESTful Workflow Patterns

All RESTful workflows fall into a pattern that includes only two fundamental
operations, which you repeat in this order for as long as necessary.

* **Make an HTTP request (GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE).**   
The target of this request is either a well-known URL (such as NSX Manager) or
a link obtained from the response to a previous request. For example, a GET
request to an Org URL returns links to vDC objects contained by the Org.
* **Examine the response, which can be an XML document or an HTTP response code.**   
If the response is an XML document, it might contain links or other
information about the state of an object. If the response is an HTTP response
code, it indicates whether the request succeeded or failed, and might be
accompanied by a URL that points to a location from which additional
information can be retrieved.

### Revision Numbers

Some API objects include a configuration version number. In some cases, this
revision number is used to prevent concurrent changes to an object. As a best
practice, before you change the configuration of an object, retrieve the latest
configuration using GET. Modify the response body as needed and use it as your
PUT request body. If the object has been modified since your GET operation, you
might see an error message.

## Finding vCenter Object IDs

Many API methods reference vCenter object IDs in URI parameters, query
parameters, request bodies, and response bodies. You can find vCenter object
IDs via the vCenter Managed Object Browser.

## vdsManage
Working With vSphere Distributed Switches
===========

### /2.0/vdn/switches

* **post** *(secured)*: Prepare a vSphere Distributed Switch.

The MTU is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted in one
packet before it is divided into smaller packets. VXLAN frames are slightly
larger in size because of the traffic encapsulation, so the MTU required
is higher than the standard MTU. You must set the MTU for each switch to
1602 or higher.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all vSphere Distributed Switches.

### /2.0/vdn/switches/datacenter/{datacenterID}
Working With vSphere Distributed Switches in a Datacenter

### /2.0/vdn/switches/{vdsId}/latency/configuration
Working With Latency Configuration of a Specific vSphere Distributed Switch
--------
Starting in NSX 6.4.5, you can use APIs to monitor the end-to-end network latency 
of a data path as traffic moves between VMs that are either on the same ESXi host 
or on different ESXi hosts. However, both the VMs must be attached to the 
same logical switch (subnet).

**Note:** NSX cannot calculate the end-to-end latency information when data 
traffic is routed between VMs through a distributed logical router. That is, 
when VMs are attached to different logical switches or subnets.

To calculate the end-to-end latency of the data path, NSX uses the **timestamp** 
attribute of a data path packet inside the hypervisor.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve the latency configuration of the specified vSphere Distributed Switch.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.4.5 | Method introduced.

## vdnConfig
Working With Segment ID Pools and Multicast Ranges
========

### /2.0/vdn/config/segments
Working With Segment ID Pools
-------------
Segment ID pools (also called segment ID ranges) provide virtual network
identifiers (VNIs) to logical switches.

You must configure a segment ID pool for each NSX Manager. You can have
more than one segment ID pool. The segment ID pool includes the beginning
and ending IDs.

You should not configure more than 10,000 VNIs in a single vCenter
server because vCenter limits the number of dvPortgroups to 10,000.

If any of your transport zones will use multicast or hybrid replication
mode, you must also configure a multicast address range.

* **post** *(secured)*: Add a segment ID pool.

* **name** - Required property.
* **desc** - Optional property.
* **begin** - Required property. Minimum value is *5000*
* **end** - Required property. Maximum value is *16777216*

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all segment ID pools.

### /2.0/vdn/config/segments/{segmentPoolId}
Working With a Specific Segment ID Pool
------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about the specified segment ID pool.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the specified segment ID pool.

If the segment ID pool is universal you must send the API request to
the primary NSX Manager.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Delete the specified segment ID pool.

If the segment ID pool is universal you must send the API request to
the primary NSX Manager.

### /2.0/vdn/config/multicasts
Working With Multicast Address Ranges
------
If any of your transport zones will use multicast or hybrid replication
mode, you must add a multicast address range (also called a multicast
address pool). Specifying a multicast address range helps in spreading
traffic across your network to avoid overloading a single multicast
address.

* **post** *(secured)*: Add a multicast address range for logical switches.

The address range includes the beginning and ending addresses.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about all configured multicast address ranges.

Universal multicast address ranges have the property isUniversal
set to *true*.

### /2.0/vdn/config/multicasts/{multicastAddresssRangeId}
Working With a Specific Multicast Address Range
--------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about the specified multicast address range.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the specified multicast address range.

If the multicast address range is universal you must send the API
request to the primary NSX Manager.

* **delete** *(secured)*: Delete the specified multicast address range.

If the multicast address range is universal you must send the API
request to the primary NSX Manager.

### /2.0/vdn/config/vxlan/udp/port
Working With the VXLAN Port Configuration
----------

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve the UDP port configured for VXLAN traffic.

### /2.0/vdn/config/vxlan/udp/port/{portNumber}
Update the VXLAN Port Configuration
-------

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the VXLAN port configuration to use port *portNumber*.

This method changes the VXLAN port in a three phrase process, avoiding
disruption of VXLAN traffic. In a cross-vCenter NSX environment,
change the VXLAN port on the primary NSX Manager to propagate this
change on all NSX Managers and hosts in the cross-vCenter NSX
environment.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------

### /2.0/vdn/config/vxlan/udp/port/taskStatus
VXLAN Port Configuration Update Status
----

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve the status of the VXLAN port configuration update.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.2.3 | Method introduced.

### /2.0/vdn/config/vxlan/udp/port/resume
Resume VXLAN Port Configuration Update
----

* **post** *(secured)*: If you update the VXLAN port using the **Change** button on
the **Installation > Logical Network Preparation** page in the vSphere
Web Client, or using `PUT
/api/2.0/vdn/config/vxlan/udp/port/{portNumber}` without the **force**
parameter, and the port update does not complete, you can try resuming
the port config change.

You can check the progress of the VXLAN port update with 
`GET /api/2.0/vdn/config/vxlan/udp/port/taskStatus`.

Only try resuming the port update if it has failed to complete. You
should not need to resume the port update under normal circumstances.

Working With Transport Zone CDO Mode
-----

* **post** *(secured)*: **Note**: From 6.4.0, CDO feature is supported at NSX Manager level and not at Transport Zone level.
For more details, refer to *Working with Controller Disconnected Operation (CDO) Mode* section.

Enable or disable CDO mode for the specified transport zone.

Controller Disconnected Operation (CDO) mode ensures that the data
plane connectivity is unaffected when host lose connectivity with the
controller. 

If you want to enable CDO mode on the universal transport zone in a
cross-vCenter NSX environment, you must do this from the primary NSX
Manager. The universal synchronization service will propagate the CDO
configuration to the secondary NSX Managers.

      * *MULTICAST_MODE*
  * **guestVlanAllowed** - Optional. Default is *false*.

## traceflows
Working With Traceflow
================
For Traceflow to work as expected, make sure that the controller cluster is
connected and in healthy state. The Traceflow operation requires active
communication between vCenter, NSX Manager, controller cluster, and netcpa
User World Agents (UWA) on the host. Traceflow observes marked packet as it
traverses overlay network. Each packet is delivered to host VM and
monitored as it crosses overlay network until it reaches the destination
VM. The packet is never delivered to the destination guest VM. This means
that Traceflow packet delivery is successful even when the guest VM is
powered down. Unknown L2 Packets are always be sent to the bridge.
Typically, the bridge forwards these packets to a VLAN and reports the
Traceflow packet as delivered. The packet which is reported as delivered
need not necessarily mean that the trace packet was delivered to the
destination specified. You should conclude only after validating the
observations.vdl2 serves ARP proxy for ARP packets coming from VMs.
However, Traceflow bypasses this process, hence vdl2 may broadcast the
Traceflow packet out.

Working Virtual Machine Connections to Logical Switches
-----

* **post** *(secured)*: Attach a VM vNIC to, or detach a VM vNIC from a logical switch.

Specify the logical switch ID in the **portgroupId** parameter. To
detach a VM vNIC from a logical switch, leave the **portgroupId** parameter
empty.

To find the ID of a VM vNIC, do the following:
1. In the vSphere MOB, navigate to the VM you want to connect or disconnect.
2. Click **config** and take note of the **instanceUuid**.
3. Click **hardware** and take note of the last three digits of the
appropriate network interface device.

Use these two values to form the VM vNIC ID.  For example, if the
**instanceUuid** is *502e71fa-1a00-759b-e40f-ce778e915f16* and the
appropriate **device** value is *device[4000]*, the **objectId** and

## arpMAC
Working With IP Discovery and MAC Learning for Logical Switches
==============
You can enable IP discovery (ARP suppression) and MAC learning for logical
switches or dvPortGroup. Enabling MAC learning builds a VLAN - MAC
pair learning table on each vNic.

This table is stored as part of the dvfilter data. During vMotion,
dvfilter saves/restores the table at the new location. The switch then
issues RARPs for all the VLAN - MAC entries in the table.

Enabling this feature avoids possible traffic loss during vMotion in the
following cases:

* the vNic is in VLAN trunk mode
* the VM is using more  than one unicast MAC address. Since Etherswitch
supports only one unicast MAC per vNic, RARP is not processed.

When a logical switch is created using the API, IP discovery is enabled,
and MAC learning is disabled.

In cross-vCenter NSX, the following applies:
* The MAC learning setting for a universal logical switch is managed
on the primary NSX Manager. Any changes are synchronized to all secondary
NSX Managers.
* The IP discovery setting for a universal logical switch is managed
separately on each NSX Manager.

**Note:** In NSX 6.2.2 and earlier you cannot disable IP discovery for
universal logical switches on secondary NSX Managers.

### /2.0/xvs/networks/{ID}/features

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve IP discovery and MAC learning information.

## nsxControllers
Working With NSX Controllers
==============
For the unicast or hybrid control plane mode,

**Note:** Controller nodes are deployed with 4 GB of memory regardless of 
which **deployType** value is provided.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.3.3 | Method updated. **deployType** is no longer required.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieves details and runtime status for all controllers.  Runtime status
can be one of the following:

  completed yet.
  * **Running** - Controller has been deployed and can respond to API
  invocation.
  * **Unknown** - Controller has been deployed but fails to respond to API
  invocation.
  
  
  When a controller is in *Running* status, the **diskLatencyAlertDetected** 
  parameter in the API response shows whether disk latency alert is 
  detected in the controller. This parameter can take one of the 
  following values:
  * **True** - Disk latency alert is detected in the controller.
  * **False** - Disk latency is not detected in the controller.
  * **Unknown** - After the controller connects with the NSX Manager, the 
  NSX Manager receives the disk latency report of the controller after a
  delay of 30 seconds.

virtual machine. However, this method checks that the VM exists
on the NSX Manager to which the API call is sent. In a
cross-vCenter active active environment, the VM might exist on
a secondary NSX Manager, and so the call would fail. 

You can instead use the `POST
/api/2.0/services/securitytags/tag/{tagId}/vm?action=attach`
method to attach universal security tags to a VM that is not
local to the primary NSX Manager. This method does not check
that the VM is local to the NSX Manager.

### /2.0/services/securitytags/selection-criteria
Working With Security Tags Unique ID Selection Criteria
-------
In NSX versions before 6.3.0, security tags are local to a NSX Manager,
and are mapped to VMs using the VM's managed object ID.

In NSX 6.3.0 and later, you can create universal security tags to use in
all NSX Managers in a cross-vCenter NSX environment.

In an active standby environment, the managed object ID for a given VM
might not be the same in the active and standby datacenters. NSX 6.3.x
introduces a Unique ID Selection Criteria on the primary NSX Manager to
use to identify VMs when attaching them to universal security tags only.
You can use them singly or in combination. The VM instance UUID is the
recommended selection criteria. See the descriptions for more
information.

The default value for the selection criteria is null and must be set
before assigning a universal security tag to a VM. The selection
criteria can be set only on the primary NSX manager and is read-only on
secondary NSX Managers.

Security Tag Assignment<br>Metadata Parameter | Description
------|-------
instance_uuid | The VM instance UUID is generally unique within a vCenter domain, however there are exceptions such as when deployments are made through snapshots. If the VM instance UUID is not unique, you can use the VM BIOS UUID in combination with the VM name.
bios_uuid | The BIOS UUID is not guaranteed to be unique within a vCenter domain, but it is always preserved in case of disaster. Use BIOS UUID in combination with VM name to reduce the chance of a duplicate ID.
vmname | If all of the VM names in an environment are unique, then VM name can be used to identify a VM across vCenters. Use VM name in combination with VM BIOS UUID to reduce the chance of a duplicate ID.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve unique ID section criteria configuration.

Authentication headers are ignored, and the credentials used 
in the request body are used instead. This request works whether 
or not basic authenication is enabled.

All NSX Manager systems in a cross-vCenter NSX environment must 
have the same enabled/disabled status for basic authentication. If you
disable basic authentication on one NSX Manager in a cross-vCenter 
NSX environment, you must disable it on all NSX Manager systems in the 
environment.

```

By default, this token is created with the default expiry value. You 
can also set a custom expiration using the *expiresInMinutes* query 
parameter.

If a user authenticates with a token, and the user is deleted or their
NSX access is disabled, their token will remain valid until the token
expires.

which indicates that the universal security group will contain members
across the cross-vCenter NSX environment.  This is the case in an
active active environment. You can add the following
objects to a universal security group with *localMembersOnly=false*
(active active):
* IP Address Set
* MAC Address Set
* Universal Security Groups with *localMembersOnly=false*

When you create a universal security group (on scope
*universalroot-0*) you can set the extendedAttribute
**localMembersOnly** to *true* to indicate that the universal security
group will contain members local to that NSX Manager only.  This is
the case in an active standby environment, because only one NSX
environment is active at a time, and the same VMs are present in each
NSX environment. You can add the following objects to a universal
security group with *localMembersOnly=true* (active standby):
* Universal Security Tag
* IP Address Set
* MAC Address Set
* Universal Security Groups with *localMembersOnly=true*
* Dynamic criteria using VM name

You can set the **localMembersOnly** attribute only when the universal
security group is created, it cannot be modified afterwards.

  * **notificationInterval** - Required. Time interval in seconds at which the NSX Manager receives host event notifications from each host. Valid range is 300 to 3600.

## dhcpStarvWhitelist
Working With DHCP Starv WhiteList
===========

Hosts use vCenter alerts and dashboard alerts to notify users about DoS attacks on the hosts.
In NSX 6.4.4 and earlier, you can enable and disable DHCP DoS attack notifications on the hosts only at the global level.
Starting with NSX Data Center 6.4.5, you can use APIs to enable or disable DHCP DoS attack notifications on a per port basis (dvPort).

By default, DHCP DoS attack notifications are enabled on all the ports. However, you can disable these notifications on the ports that are expected to route DHCP packets.
NSX 6.4.5 introduces APIs to create and modify a **DHCP Starv Whitelist**, which you can use to exclude selected ports from checking DHCP DoS attack notifications.
For example, you can identify the third-party router VMs and disable notifications for the ports on those VMs by using the APIs.
On the ESG VMs, the APIs are automatically executed to whitelist all the vNICs of the ESG VMs, and no user intervention is required.

**Note**: With NSX, you cannot whitelist ports when a VM or an Edge is connected to a VLAN-based port group.

**DHCP Starv Whitelist Parameters**

Parameter |  Description | Comments
---|---|---
**vmId** |Object ID of the virtual machine. |Required.
**virtualWire** |Object ID of the virtualwire (logical switch). |Required. For example, *virtualwire-1*.
**vnicUuid** |Index of the vNIC for a VM.|Optional. Use the *VMInstanceUuid.deviceId* format to specify the vNIC of a VM (vnicId). For example, *564d05d4-29f3-94ad-7fa5-47ca2be93796.000*. If you omit the **vnicUuid**, all vNICs for that VM and virtualwire combination are added to the whitelist.

### /2.0/vdn/hostevents/dhcp-starv-whitelist

* **post** *(secured)*: Create a new DHCP starv whitelist to exclude selected distributed virtual ports (dvPorts) from checking DoS attacks on hosts.
In the whitelist, specify combinations of vmId, virtualwire, and vnicId to identify ports on the dvSwitch that you want to exclude.

In a multi-vCenter environment, you must create a separate whitelist that is local to the NSX Manager and vCenter combination. For universal virtualwires,
unique dvPortGroups are created on the dvSwitches that participate in the logical network. NSX Manager associated with the vCenter Server
manages the ports created on the dvPortGroups in that vCenter.

**Note**: It is recommended to remove the whitelist entries **before** the following situations occur, else the whitelist might grow **unrestricted**:
* Third-party router VMs are deleted.
* vNICs on the third-party router VMs are deleted or reconfigured to another logical switch (virtualwire).
      
For example, imagine that you have a third-party router VM connected to dvPort1 and dvPort1 is added to the whitelist. Now, you want to move the VM
from dvPort1 to dvPort2. Before moving the VM, first remove dvPort1 from the whitelist, and then add dvPort2 to the whitelist.
To summarize, use the following workflow:
* Run the DELETE API request (without force option) to remove dvPort1 from the whitelist.
* Move the VM from dvPort1 to dvPort2.
* Run the POST API request to add dvPort2 to the whitelist.

  perform other bootstrapping tasks which do not depend on
  VIB-installation. e.g. VXLAN creates the vmknic-pg and sets up some
  opaque data.
  * Post-VIB install: Prepare each host for the feature. In the case of
  VXLAN, create vmknics.

* **post** *(secured)*: Install network fabric or VXLAN.

This method can be used to perform the following tasks: 
* Install Network Virtualization Components
* Configure VXLAN
* Configure VXLAN with LACPv2

## securityFabric
Working With Security Fabric and Security Services
======
The security fabric simplifies and automates deployment of security
services and provide a platform for configuration of the elements that are
required to provide security to workloads. These elements include:

Internal components:
* Guest Introspection Universal Service Virtual Machine
* Guest Introspection Mux
* Logical Firewall

External components:
* Partner OVFs / VIBs
* Partner vendor policy templates

For partner services, the overall workflow begins with registration of
services by partner consoles, followed by deployment of the services by
the administrator.

Subsequent workflow is as follows:
1. Select the clusters on which to deploy the security fabric (Mux,
Traffic filter, USVM).
2. Specify an IP pool to be used with the SVMs (available only if the
partner registration indicates requirement of static IPs)
3. Select portgroup (DVPG) to be used for each cluster (a default is
pre-populated for the user).
4. Select datastore to be used for each cluster (a default is
pre-populated for the user).
5. NSX Manager deploys the components on all hosts of the selected
clusters.

Once you deploy the security fabric, an agency defines the configuration
needed to deploy agents (host components and appliances). An agency is
created per cluster per deployment spec associated with services.  Agents
are deployed on the selected clusters, and events / hooks for all the
relevant actions are generated.

**Request parameters**

Parameter | Description 
-------|---------
dataStore |Needs to be specified only in POST call. In PUT call, it should be left empty. 
dvPortGroup |Optional. If not specified, then user will set the Agent using vCenter Server. 
ipPool |Optional. If not specified, IP address is assigned through DHCP. 

### /2.0/si/deploy

* **post** *(secured)*: Deploy security fabric.

* **put** *(secured)*: Upgrade service to recent version.

----

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve all clusters on which the service is installed.
* **delete** *(secured)*: Uninstall specified service from specified clusters.

### /2.0/si/deploy/service/{serviceID}/dependsOn
Working With Service Dependencies
----
Services installed through the security fabric may be dependent on
other services. When an internal service is registered, a dependencyMap
is maintained with the service-id and implementation type of the
internal service.

When partner registers a new service, the security fabric looks up its
implementation type in the dependencyMap to identify the service it
depends on, if any. Accordingly, a new field in Service object called
dependsOn-service-id is populated.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve service on which the specified service depends.

### /2.0/si/deploy/cluster/{clusterID}

---

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve all services deployed along with their status.

## eventControl
Working With Data Collection for Activity Monitoring
===========
Activity Monitoring provides visibility into your virtual network to
ensure that security policies at your organization are being enforced
correctly.

A Security policy may mandate who is allowed access to what applications.
The Cloud administrator can generate Activity Monitoring reports to see if
the IP based firewall rule that they set is doing the intended work. By
providing user and application level detail, Activity Monitoring
translates high level security policies to low level IP address and
network based implementation.

Once you enable data collection for Activity Monitoring, you can run
reports to view inbound traffic (such as virtual machines being accessed
by users) as well as outbound traffic (resource utilization, interaction
between inventory containers, and AD groups that accessed a server).

You must enable data collection for one or more virtual machines on a
vCenter Server before running an Activity Monitoring report. Before
running a report, ensure that the enabled virtual machines are active and
are generating network traffic.

You should also register NSX Manager with the AD Domain Controller. See
"Working With Domains".

Note that only active connections are tracked by Activity Monitoring.
Virtual machine traffic blocked by firewall rules at the vNIC level is not
reflected in reports.

In case of an emergency such as a network overload, you can turn off data
collection at a global level. This overrides all other data collection
settings.

Some API calls may require the VMID, which is the MOID of the guest
virtual machine. You can retrieve this by queuing the vCenter mob
structure (https:VC-IP-Address/mob). The VMID is listed under host
structure.

### /1.0/eventcontrol/vm/{vmID}/request
Working With Data Collection on a Specific Virtual Machine
----
You must enable data collection at least five minutes before running an
Activity Monitoring report.

* **post** *(secured)*: Enable or disable data collection on a virtual machine

Set **value** to *enabled* or *disabled*.

### /1.0/eventcontrol/eventcontrol-root/request
Override Data Collection
----

* **post** *(secured)*: Turn data collection on or off at the global level.

In case of an emergency such as a network overload, you can turn off
data collection at a global level (kill switch). This overrides all
other data collection settings.

Set **value** to *enabled* or *disabled*.

### /1.0/eventcontrol/config/vm/{vmID}
Retrieve Data Collection Configuration for a Specific Virtual Machine
-----
When reporting per virtual machine configuration, current kill switch
status is also reported too. The effective configuration of a virtual
machine is determined by both kill switch config and per virtual machine
configuration. If kill switch is on, event collection is effectively
disabled regardless of what its per virtual machine configuration is; if
kill switch is off, per virtual machine configuration determines whether
event collection should be performed for this virtual machine.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve per VM configuration for data collection.

## domain
Working With Domains
===========
After you create a domain, you can apply a security policy to it and run
queries to view the applications and virtual machines being accessed by
the users of a domain.

### /1.0/directory/updateDomain
Registering Domains
---------------
You can a register one or more Windows domains with an NSX Manager and
associated vCenter server.  NSX Manager gets group and user information
as well as the relationship between them from each domain that it is
registered with. NSX Manager also retrieves Active Directory
credentials.  You can apply security policies on an Active Directory
domain and run queries to get information on virtual machines and
applications accessed by users within an Active Directory domain.

**Parameter Values for Registering or Updating a Domain**

Parameter Name | Description | Required? 
----------------|-------------|------------
**ID** |  Domain id.  If you want to create a new domain, do not provide this value.  Otherwise, the system will find an existing domain object by this ID and update it. | Required if updating existing domain 
**name** |  Domain name.  This should be the domain's fully qualified name. If it's agent discovered, this will be the NetBIOS name, so you need to update it to FQN in order to support LDAP sync and event log reader. | Required if creating a new domain. 
**description** | Domain description | Optional. 
**type** | Domain type. Valid values include: AGENT_DISCOVERED, ACTIVE_DIRECTORY, SPECIAL (Do NOT modify SPECIAL domain). For LDAP sync and event log reader work, this need to be set to ACTIVE_DIRECTORY. | Optional. Default is ACTIVE_DIRECTORY.
**netbiosName** |  NetBIOS name of domain. This is the domain's NetBIOS name. Normally Agent reported domain name is the NetBIOS name. Confirm from Windows domain settings. | Optional. 
**baseDn** | Domain's Base DN (for LDAP sync).  Base DN is required for LDAP Sync. If you have a domain like: w2k3.vshield.vmware.com, the base DN is very likely to be: DC=w2k3,DC=vshield,DC=vmware,DC=com. Another example is: domain name is: vs4.net, the base DN should be: DC=vs4,DC=net. You can use a LDAP client and connect to domain controller to find the domain's base DN. |  Optional. Required for LDAP sync.
**rootDn** | LDAP Sync root DN.  Specify where should LDAP sync start from LDAP tree. This could be an absolute path, for example: OU=Engineer,DC=vs4,DC=net, or a relative path (relative to Base DN), for example: OU=Engineer. |  Optional.
**rootDnItem** | Root DN item. Use instead of **rootDn** if the domain has multiple rootDn values. | Optional.
**securityId** | Domain's Security ID (SID). This should be filled by LDAP sync process, and should not need to be modified. |  Optional. 
**username** |  Domain's User name (Used for LDAP Sync and/or Event Log reader) | Optional. 
**password** | User password | Optional.
**eventLogUsername** | Domain's event log reader username (will use above username if this is NULL) | Optional.
**eventLogPassword** | Domain's event log reader password | Optional.

* **post** *(secured)*: Register or update a domain with NSX Manager

**Example: Domain with one root DN**
  
    <DirectoryDomain>
      <name>example.com</name>
      <netbiosName>Example</netbiosName>
      <baseDn>DC=example,DC=com</baseDn>
      <rootDn>OU=prod,DC=example,DC=com</rootDn>
      <username>Administrator</username>
      <password>xxx</password>
    </DirectoryDomain>

**Example: Domain with multiple root DN**

    <DirectoryDomain>
      <name>example.com</name>
      <netbiosName>Example</netbiosName>
      <baseDn>DC=example,DC=com</baseDn>
      <rootDnItem>OU=prod,DC=example,DC=com</rootDnItem>
      <rootDnItem>OU=test,DC=example,DC=com</rootDnItem>

## servicesSystemAlarms
Working With Alarms
========

Alarms are notifications that are activated in response to an event, a set
of conditions, or the state of an object. Alarms, along with other alerts,
are displayed on the Dashboard and other screens on the vSphere Web
Client UI.

See "Alarms" in the *NSX Logging and System Events Guide* for more information.

Generally, an alarm gets automatically deleted by the system when the error
condition is rectified.  Some alarms are not automatically cleared on a
configuration update. Once the issue is resolved, you have to clear the
alarms manually.   

**Alarm Parameters**

Paramter | Description | Comments
----|-----|------
**resolutionAttempted** | Was resolution of the alarm was attempted? | *true* or *false*. 
**resolvable** | Can the alarm be resolved? | *true* or *false*
**alarmId** | ID of the alarm. | For example, *79965*.
**alarmCode** | Event code which uniquely identifies the system event. | For example, *130027*. 
**alarmSource** | The domain object identifier of the source where you can resolve the reported alarm. | For example, *edge-3*.
**totalCount** | The total number of unresolved alarms. | 

### /2.0/services/systemalarms

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve all unresolved alarms on NSX Manager.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.3.3 | Method introduced.

### /2.0/services/systemalarms/{alarmId}
Working With a Specific System Alarm
-------
You can view and resolve alarms by alarm ID. 

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve information about the specified alarm. Both resolved and
unresolved alarms can be retrieved.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.3.0 | Method introduced.

* **post** *(secured)*: Resolve the specified alarm.

System alarms resolve automatically when the cause of the alarm is resolved.
For example, if an NSX Edge appliance is powered off, this triggers a
alarm. If you power the NSX Edge appliance back on, the alarm resolves.
If however, you delete the NSX Edge appliance, the alarm persists,
because the alarm cause was never resolved. In this case, you might want
to manually resolve the alarm. Resolving the alarm will clear it from
the NSX Dashboard.         

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.3.0 | Method introduced.

## servicesAlarmsSource
Working With Alarms from a Specific Source
=====

You can view and resolve alarms from a specific source.

### /2.0/services/alarms/{sourceId}

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrive all alarms from the specified source.

* **post** *(secured)*: Resolve all alarms for the specified source.

Alarms will resolve automatically when the cause of the alarm is
resolved.  For example, if an NSX Edge appliance is powered off, this
will trigger an alarm. If you power the NSX Edge appliance back on, the
alarm will resolve. If however, you delete the NSX Edge appliance, the
alarm will persist, because the alarm cause was never resolved. In this
case, you may want to manually resolve the alarm. Resolving the alarms
will clear them from the Dashboard.

Use `GET /api/2.0/services/alarms/{sourceId}` to retrieve the list of
alarms for the source. Use this response as the request body for the
`POST` call.

## CapacityParameter
Working With System Scale (Capacity Parameter) Dashboard
===================
The System Scale (Capacity Parameter) dashboard displays information about the current object count, maximum object supported 
by the system, and  percentage usage for each parameter.
The capacity parameter report collects information about the current system scale and the supported scale
parameters. It also allows you to view a warning threshold value  and percentage usage for each the parameter. 
It also allows you to view and configure a warning threshold value at the system level. If the current global threshold values
exceeds a specified threshold value, a warning indicator is displayed on the UI to alert that the maximum 
supported scale is approaching. 
This information is also logged and included in the support bundle.

  **Expressions**:
  --------------
  Expressions can be used in widget configurations. Expressions should be evaluable on their own without any “variable declaration”. 
  For example, you can give following expressions:
    * Arithmetic:
      (1 + 2)= evaluates to 3
      (12.0 - 5.2) = evaluates to 6.8
      (6 * 12 + 5 / 2.6) = evaluates to 73.923
      (12 % 2)= evaluates to 0
      (6 / 4 )= evaluates to 1.5
      (-12 + 77.2) = evaluates to 65.2
      (x * 1.1 + y) = Not allowed as x and y are not defined.
    * Calling methods:
      "(\"\").isEmpty()" = evaluates to boolean true.
    * Accessing properties:
      "(\"Some long string\").length == 16" = evaluates to boolean true. But you can not give expressions like:
        “V1 + 2” 
        “aString.length()” and so on because these expressions require the definition of “V1” and “aString” to be present in the context, and there is no place in widget configuration to define it. 
         * No Java statements are supported, only expressions are supported.

  **Anatomy of an Expression in Widget Configuration**
      * Expression
       * Basic form: #{<datasource>.<url-alias>.<jsonpath>}
       * Examples:
           * Expression:   #{default.si.versionInfo.majorVersion}       
           * API: api/1.0/appliance-management/summary/system             
      * Expression:   #{default.si.cpuInfoDto.totalNoOfCPUs}                             
           * API:  api/1.0/appliance-management/summary/system
           * Expression:  #{default.summary.preparedHostsTotalNumber}                           
           * API: api/2.0/vdn/inventory/hosts/status/summary
           * Function form: #{<datasource>.<url-alias>.<jsonpath>}.function()
           * Example:
      * Expression:  #{default.se.dataPage.data}.size()                    
           * API: api/2.0/systemevent

  **Anatomy of a Condition in Widget Configuration**
       * Condition
          * Evaluates to a boolean (true or false)
           * Form: expression == value
              * Examples: 
                  #{default.status.degraded_count} < 10
                  #{default.status.results}.size() < 10
                  #{default.status.status} == \"INSTALLED_DISABLED\"
                  #{default.config.allow_mirrored} == true
                  #{default.config.allow_mirrored}        //A boolean can be used directly in expression.

### /2.0/services/dashboard/ui-views/dashboard/widgetconfigurations

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieves configuration details for all the widgets available on dashboard.
 
**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.4.0 | Method introduced.

* **post** *(secured)*: Creates a new Widget Configuration and adds it to the default Dashboard on UI. Supported resource_type are *LabelValueConfiguration* and *GridConfiguration*.

**Notes for Expressions in Widget Configuration**

Expressions should be given in a single line. If an expression spans multiple lines, then form the expression in a single line. 
Order of evaluation of expressions is as follows:<br>
* First, render configurations are evaluated in their order of appearance in the widget configuration. 
The *field* is evaluated at the end.
* Next, when render configuration is provided then the order of evaluation is as follows: 
  
    * If expressions provided in condition and display value are well-formed and free  of runtime errors such as null pointers 
    and evaluates to true; then the remaining render configurations are not evaluated, and the current render configurations 
    *display value* is taken as the final value.
    
    * If expression provided in condition of render configuration is false, then next render configuration is evaluated. 
    
    * Finally, field is evaluated only when every render configuration evaluates to false and no error occurs during steps mentioned above.
    
    If an error occurs during evaluation of render configuration, then an error message: "__ERROR__: See the Error_Messages field of 
    this report for details" is shown. The display value corresponding to that label is not shown and evaluation of the 
    remaining render configurations continues to collect and show all the error messages (marked with the Label for identification)
    as Error_Messages: {}. If during evaluation of expressions for any label-value pair an error occurs, 
    then it is marked with error. The errors are shown in the report, along with the label value pairs that are error-free.
    
**Important Note for text in condition, field and render configuration's display value**: 
For elements that take expressions, strings should be provided by escaping them with a back-slash. These elements are - condition, field and render_configuration's display_value.

**Notes for Drilldowns**:
Only *GridConfiguration* is supported as drilldown widget. To make a widget as a drilldown, its category_id should be set as *drilldown*. Drilldowns are supported for *aggregate_count* (subtype of *LabelValueConfiguration*) widgets only.  In other words, only 'aggregate_count' widgets can have drilldowns.

**Notes for Sharing the widget to other users**:
Use a valid vsphere user, who has an NSX role assigned that has sufficient permissions, to create the widget and it will get displayed on the UI when that vsphere user logs in. For other users to view the widget on the UI, the owner (user who owners that widget) needs to share the widget (set **shared** parameter to *true*).

## guestIntrospection
Working With Guest Introspection and Third-party Endpoint Protection (Anti-virus) Solutions
============

About Guest Introspection and Endpoint Protection Solutions
----------
VMware's Guest Introspection Service enables vendors to deliver an
introspection-based, endpoint protection (anti-virus) solution that uses
the hypervisor to scan guest virtual machines from the outside, with only
a thin agent on each guest virtual machine.

Version Compatibility
-----------

**Note:** The management APIs listed in this section are to be used only
with partner endpoint protection solutions that were developed with EPSec
Partner Program 3.0 or earlier (for vShield 5.5 or earlier).  These
partner solutions are also supported on NSX 6.0 and need the APIs listed
below.  These APIs should not be used with partner solutions developed
specifically for NSX 6.0 or later, as these newer solutions automate the
registration and deployment process by using the new features introduced
in NSX.  Using these with newer NSX 6.0 based solutions could result in
loss of features.

Register a Solution
----------

To register a third-party solution with Guest Introspection, clients can
use four REST calls to do the following:
1. Register the vendor.
2. Register one or more solutions.
3. Set the solution IP address and port (for all hosts).
4. Activate registered solutions per host.

**Note:** Steps 1 through 3 need to be performed once per solution. Step 4
needs to be performed for each host.

Unregister a Solution
----------

To unregister a solution, clients perform these steps in reverse:
1. Deactivate solutions per host.
2. Unset a solution’s IP address and port.
3. Unregister solutions.
4. Unregister the vendor.

Updating Registration Information
-----------

To update registration information for a vendor or solution, clients must:
1. Unregister the vendor or solution.
2. Reregister the vendor or solution.

The output of this method can be used to restore the firewall config
back to default. For example, to replace the layer 2 or layer 3
default section, use the relevant default section from the `GET

Starting in NSX 6.4.0, the following attributes can be configured at the section level.

Attribute | Description | Default for new sections
----|----
**tcpStrict** | If TCP strict is enabled on a rule and a packet matches that rule, the following check will be performed. If the packet does not belong to an existing session, the kernel will check to see if the SYN flag of the packet is set. If it is not, then it will drop the packet. | *false* for all section types.
**stateless** | If stateless is enabled on a rule, traffic is monitored statically, and the state of network connections will be ignored. | *true* for L2, *false* for L3 and L3 redirect.
**useSid** | If useSid is enabled on a rule, the source field of the rule must be an Active Directory Security Group.  | *false* for all section types.

**tcpStrict** was previously configured in the global firewall
configuration: `PUT /api/4.0/firewall/config/globalconfiguration`. If you
upgrade to NSX 6.4.0 or later, the global configuration setting
for **tcpStrict** is used to configure **tcpStrict** in each existing
layer 3 section. **tcpStrict** is set to *false* in layer 2 sections and
layer 3 redirect sections. **stateless** and **useSid** are new attributes
in NSX 6.4.0 and are set to the default values during upgrade.

Once all hosts are upgraded to NSX 6.4.0, the global **tcpStrict** parameter
is ignored.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve distributed firewall rule configuration.

If no query parameters are used, all rule configuration is retrieved.
Use the query parameters to filter the rule configuration information.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.4.0 | Method updated. **tcpStrict**, **stateless**, and **useSid** added as **section** attributes.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the complete firewall configuration in all sections.

* Retrieve the configuration with `GET /api/4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config`.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the Etag value, and submit the request.
* Starting in NSX 6.4.5, the Etag value returned in the response header of
  `GET /api/4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config` contains double quotes. You must 
  strip off the double quotes before using the Etag value in the If-Match header.
  If you are using the PUT API request in an automation script, ensure that the 
  script strips off the double quotes in the Etag value.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,
if an IP set is referenced in the rule only IPSet and Type is needed in the
Source/Destination objects and not Name and isValid tags.

When updating the firewall configuration:
* IDs for new objects (rule/section) should be removed or set to zero.
* If new entities (sections/rules) have been sent in the request, the response
  will contain the system-generated IDs, which are assigned to these new
  entities.
* **appliedTo** can be any valid firewall rule element.
* **action** can be *ALLOW*, *BLOCK*, or *REJECT*. REJECT sends reject message for
  unaccepted packets; RST packets are sent for TCP connections and ICMP
  unreachable code packets are sent for UDP, ICMP, and other IP connections
* source and destination can have an exclude flag. For example, if you add an
  exclude tag for 1.1.1.1 in the source parameter, the rule looks for traffic
  originating from all IPs other than 1.1.1.1.

**Method history:**

--------|-------------
6.4.0 | Method updated. **tcpStrict**, **stateless**, and **useSid** added as **section** attributes.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config/layer3sections
Working With Layer 3 Sections in Distributed Firewall
-----

You can use sections in the firewall table to group logical rules based on
AppliedTo or for a tenant use case. A firewall section is the smallest unit of
configuration which can be updated independently. Section types are as
follows:
* Layer3Section contains layer3 rules
* Layer2Section contains layer2 rules
* Layer3RedirectSection contains traffic redirect rules.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall sections
created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute in the XML called
managedBy. You should not modify Service Composer firewall sections using
Distributed Firewall REST APIs.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config/layer3sections/{sectionId}/rules
Working With Distributed Firewall Rules in a Layer 3 Section
----

* **post** *(secured)*: Add rules to the specified layer 3 section in distributed firewall.

You add firewall rules at the global scope. You can then narrow down the scope
(datacenter, cluster, distributed virtual port group, network, virtual machine,
vNIC, or logical switch) at which you want to apply the rule. Firewall allows
you to add multiple objects at the source and destination levels for each rule,
which helps reduce the total number of firewall rules to be added.  To add a
identity based firewall rule, first create a security group based on Directory
Group objects. Then create a firewall rule with the security group as the
source or destination.  Rules that direct traffic to a third part service are
referred to as layer3 redirect rules, and are displayed in the layer3 redirect
tab.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall
rules created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute
in the XML called managedBy.

Follow this procedure to add a rule:

* Retrieve the configuration for the specified section.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
  **Note**: Each section contains its own Etag, generationNumber, and
  timestamp. When adding a new rule, you must use the Etag value of the
  firewall section to which you wish to add the rule.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the section Etag value, and submit the request.
* Starting in NSX 6.4.5, the Etag value returned in the response header of the 
  GET API request contains double quotes. You must strip off the double quotes 
  before using the Etag value in the If-Match header. If you are using the POST 
  API request in an automation script, ensure that the script strips off the 
  double quotes in the Etag value.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/state
Enable Distributed Firewall After Upgrade
-----
After upgrading NSX Manager, controllers, and network virtualization

enable, you can enable distributed firewall.

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| backwardCompatible | This is the default state after an upgrade from vCloud Networking and Security to NSX, which means that vShield App is being used for protection instead of distributed firewall.|
| backwardCompatibleReadyForSwitch | Once the clusters are prepared with NSX binaries, this state is enabled. You can enable distributed firewall only after firewall is in this state. |
| switchingToForward | This is an intermediate state when you change firewall to distributed firewall. |
| forward | This is the default state for green field deployments or after you have switched from vShield App to distributed firewall. |
| switchFailed | This state is unlikely, but may be present if NSX Manager failed to switch to distributed firewall. |

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve current state of firewall functioning after NSX upgrade.

* **put** *(secured)*: Enable distributed firewall.

### /4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/status
Working With Distributed Firewall Status
----
Retrieve status of last publish action for each cluster in the NSX
environment.

The status output displays a generation number (**generationNumber**) for
each rule set, which can be used to verify whether a change in rule sets
has propagated to a host. In 6.2.4, a generation number for objects
(**generationNumberObjects**) has been added to the status API. This allows
you to verify whether a change in objects consumed in firewall rules has
propagated to a host. Note that the object generation number may change
frequently and will always be equal to or greater than the ruleset
generation number.

Starting in NSX 6.2.4, clusters (and hosts inside the cluster) are no
longer included in the firewall status output if distributed firewall is
disabled at the cluster level, or if the cluster is not prepared (NSX
VIBs are not installed). In earlier versions of NSX these clusters and
hosts are included in the output. However, because they are not
configured for firewall, after a firewall rule publish their status is
*inprogress*.

### /4.0/firewall/config/globalconfiguration
Working With the Distributed Firewall Global Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------
You can use the following parameters to improve firewall performance:

* **layer3RuleOptimize** and **layer2RuleOptimize** to turn
on/off rule optimization.
* **tcpStrictOption** determines whether or not to drop an established
TCP connection when the firewall does not see the initial three-way
handshake. If set to true, the connection will be dropped.   
**Note**: starting in NSX 6.4.0 this setting in the global configuration is 
ignored. **tcpStrict** is instead configured at the section level. See 
"Working with Distributed Firewall Configuration" for more information.
* **autoDraftDisabled** improves performances when making large numbers
of changes to firewall rules.
* **ruleStatsDisabled** describes the state of the rule stats collection. Default value for this field is *false* meaning rule stats collection will be enabled by default. Set the value to *true* to disable rule stats collection on NSX Manager and hosts.

You can disable the auto draft feature by setting **autoDraftDisabled** to
true. Distributed Firewall saves up to 100 configurations, including
manually saved drafts (**preserve** parameter can be set to true or
false) and auto saved drafts (**preserve** parameter is set to false).
Once 100 configurations are saved, older drafts with the **preserve**
parameter set to false will be deleted in order to save new
configurations. You might want to disable the auto drafts feature before
making large numbers of changes to the firewall rules, to improve
performance, and to prevent previously saved drafts from being
overwritten.

Note: The **autoDraftDisabled** parameter does not appear in a GET of the global
configuration.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve performance configuration for distributed firewall.

## spoofGuard
Working With SpoofGuard
==========
After synchronizing with the vCenter Server, NSX Manager collects the IP
addresses of all vCenter guest virtual machines. If a virtual machine has
been compromised, the IP address can be spoofed and malicious
transmissions can bypass firewall policies.

You create a SpoofGuard policy for specific networks that allows you to
authorize the reported IP addresses and alter them if necessary to prevent
spoofing.  SpoofGuard inherently trusts the MAC addresses of virtual
machines collected from the VMX files and vSphere SDK. Operating
separately from Firewall rules, you can use SpoofGuard to block traffic
determined to be spoofed.

### /4.0/services/spoofguard/policies/
Working With SpoofGuard Policies
---------
You can create a SpoofGuard policy to specify the operation mode for
specific networks. The system generated policy applies to port groups
and logical switches not covered by existing SpoofGuard policies.

The operationMode for a SpoofGuard policy can be set to one of the
following:

* **TOFU** - Automatically trust IP assignments on their first use
* **MANUAL** - Manually inspect and approve all IP assignments before first
use
* **DISABLE** - Disable the SpoofGuard policy

* **post** *(secured)*: Create a SpoofGuard policy to specify the operation mode for networks.

**Note:** you must include the trailing slash for this URI:
`/api/4.0/services/spoofguard/policies/`.

Response values for flow statistics:
* **blocked** - indicates whether traffic is blocked:
  * 0 - flow allowed
  * 1 - flow blocked
  * 2 - flow blocked by SpoofGuard
* **protocol** - protocol in flow:
  * 0 - TCP
  * 1 - UDP
  * 2 - ICMP
* **direction** - direction of flow:
  * 1 - from virtual machine

* minimum start time
* maximum end time
* total flow count

### /2.1/app/flow/config
Working With Flow Monitoring Configuration
----

Flow records generated on all hosts are sent to NSX Manager, which
consumes the records and displays aggregated information.  Hosts can
generate large numbers of flow records.  You can configure flow
monitoring to exclude certain records from collection.  The flow
configuration applies to all hosts.

* **collectFlows** - if true, flow collection is enabled.
* **ignoreBlockedFlows** - if true, ignore blocked flows.
* **ignoreLayer2Flows** - if true, ignore layer 2 flows.
* **sourceIPs** - source IPs to exclude. For example: 10.112.3.14, 10.112.3.15-10.112.3.18,192.168.1.1/24.
* **sourceContainer** - source containers to exclude. Containers can contain VM, vNic, IP Set, MAC Set.
* **destinationIPs** - destination IPs to exclude.
* **destinationContainer** - destination containers to exclude. Containers can contain VM, vNic, IP Set, MAC Set.
* **destinationPorts** - destination ports to exclude.
* **serviceContainers** - service containers to exclude. Container can contain application or application group.

Flow exclusion happens at the host. The following flows are discarded by default:
* Broadcast IP (255.255.255.255)
* Local multicast group (224.0.0.0/24)
* Broadcast MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)

---

* **put** *(secured)*: Add a vm to the exclusion list.
* **delete** *(secured)*: Delete a vm from exclusion list.

## nsxEdges
Working With NSX Edge
=======
There are two types of NSX Edge: Edge services gateway and logical
(distributed) router.

### Edge Services Gateway

The services gateway gives you access to all NSX Edge services such as
firewall, NAT, DHCP, VPN, load balancing, and high availability. You can
install multiple Edge services gateway virtual appliances in a
datacenter. Each Edge service gateway virtual appliance can have a
total of ten uplink and internal network interfaces. 

The internal interfaces connect to secured port groups and act as the
gateway for all protected virtual machines in the port group. The subnet
assigned to the internal interface can be a publicly routed IP space or
a NATed/routed RFC 1918 private space. Firewall rules and other NSX Edge
services are enforced on traffic between network interfaces.

Uplink interfaces of NSX Edge connect to uplink port groups that have
access to a shared corporate network or a service that provides access
layer networking. Multiple external IP addresses can be configured for
load balancer, site-to-site VPN, and NAT services.

### Logical (Distributed) Router

The logical router provides East-West distributed routing with tenant IP
address space and data path isolation. Virtual machines or workloads
that reside on the same host on different subnets can communicate with
one another without having to traverse a traditional routing interface.

A logical router can have up to 9 uplink interfaces and up to 990
internal interfaces.

### /4.0/edges

* **post** *(secured)*: You can install NSX Edge as a services gateway or as a logical router.

The **type** parameter determines which type of NSX Edge is deployed:
*distributedRouter* or *gatewayServices*. If no type is specified, the
type is *gatewayServices*.

Other parameters for this method will differ depending on which type of
NSX Edge you are deploying. See the examples and parameter tables for
more information.

### NSX Edge: Service Gateway

The NSX Edge installation API copies the NSX Edge OVF from the Edge
Manager to the specified datastore and deploys an NSX Edge on the given
datacenter. After the NSX Edge is installed, the virtual machine powers
on and initializes according to the given network configuration. If an
appliance is added, it is deployed with the specified configuration.

Installing an NSX Edge instance adds a virtual machine to the vCenter
Server inventory, you must specify an IP address for the management
interface, and you may name the NSX Edge instance.

The configuration you specify when you install an NSX Edge is stored in
the database. If an appliance is added, the configuration is applied to
it and it is deployed.

NOTE: Do not use hidden/system resource pool IDs as they are not
supported on the UI.

Before installing a logical router, you must prepare the hosts on the
appropriate clusters. 

The user specified configuration is stored in the database
and Edge identifier is returned to the user. This identifier must be
used for future configurations on the given Edge.  If any appliance(s)
are specified and at least one connected interface/vnic is specified,
then the appliance(s) are deployed and configuration is applied to them.

It is not possible to set the <ecmp>true</ecmp> property upon creation
of a distributed logical router Edge and a subsequent API call is
required to enable ECMP.

DHCP relay settings are not able to be used when creating a distributed
logical router Edge and a subsequent API call is required to configure
DHCP relay properties.

If your REST client is configured to not follow redirects, see the
Location header to find the location of the tech support logs on the
NSX Manager web server. You can retrieve the logs from
`https://<nsxmgr-address>/<location>`.

Example in curl:
```
$ curl -k -i -s -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46Vk13YXJlMSE=' -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -H "Accept: application/xml" -X GET https://192.168.110.42/api/4.0/edges/edge-4/techsupportlogs

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/firewall/config
Working With NSX Edge Firewall Configuration
----
Configures firewall for an Edge and stores the specified configuration
in database. If any appliances are associated with this Edge, applies
the configuration to them. While using this API, you should send the
globalConfig, defaultPolicy and the rules. If either of them are not
sent, the previous config if any on those fields will be removed and
will be changed to the system defaults.  

**ruleId** uniquely identifies a rule and should be specified only for
rules that are being updated.  If **ruleTag** is specified, the rules
on Edge are configured using this user input. Otherwise, Edge is
configured using **ruleIds** generated by NSX Manager.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/nat/config
Working With NAT Configuration
-----
NSX Edge provides network address translation (NAT) service to protect
the IP addresses of internal (private) networks from the public
network.

You can configure NAT rules to provide access to services running on
privately addressed virtual machines.  You can configure source NAT (SNAT) 
and destination NAT (DNAT) rules.

For the data path to work, you need to add firewall rules to allow the
required traffic for IP addresses and port per the NAT rules.

You can also configure NAT64 rules to allow access from IPv6 networks
to IPv4 networks.

You must configure your Edge Services Gateway to have the IPv6 address
configured on an uplink interface, and the IPv4 address configured on an
internal interface.

See the *NSX Administration Guide* for more information about NAT64, 
including how to configure the Edge Services Gateway, and what features 
of NAT64 are supported.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/routing/config
Working With the NSX Edge Routing Configuration
----
You can specify static and dynamic routing for each NSX Edge.

Dynamic routing provides the necessary forwarding information between
layer 2 broadcast domains, thereby allowing you to decrease layer 2
broadcast domains and improve network efficiency and scale. NSX
extends this intelligence to where the workloads reside for doing
East-West routing. This allows more direct virtual machine to virtual
machine communication without the costly or timely need to extend
hops. At the same time, NSX also provides North-South connectivity,
thereby enabling tenants to access public networks.

**mtu**  | The maximum transmission value for the data packets |Default is 1500. The MTU value cannot be higher than the MTU value set on the NSX Edge interface. By default, mtu is the MTU value of the interface on which the route is configured. 
**vnic**  | Interface on which the default route is added. |
**gatewayAddress**  | Default gateway IP used for routing. |
**adminDistance**  |Admin distance. Used to determine which routing protocol to use if two protocols provide route information for the same destination. | Optional. Default value is *1*.

### Static Route Configuration

Parameter  |   Description  | Comments  
--- | --- | --- 
**vnic**  | Interface on which the route is added. | Valid values: *0-4103*, *vNic_[0-4103]*, *gre-[1-96]*.

### OSPF Configuration

Parameter  |   Description  | Comments  
--- | --- | --- 
**enabled**  | OSPF enabled status. |  When not specified, it will be treated as false, When false, it will delete the existing config.

**type**  | Gives whether the type is *normal* or *nssa*. | Optional.  Default type is normal. NSSAs (the not-so-stubby areas feature described in RFC 3101) prevents the flooding of AS-external link-state advertisements (LSAs). They rely on default routing to external destinations. Therefore, NSSAs are placed at the edge of an OSPF routing domain. NSSA can import external routes into the OSPF routing domain, thereby providing transit service to small routing domains that are not part of the OSPF routing domain.
**authentication > type**  | Authentication type. | Choice of *none*, *password*, or *md5*. If authentication information isn't provided, type is *none*. Type *password*: a password is included in the transmitted packet. Type *md5*: an MD5 checksum is included in the transmitted packet.

**cost**  | The default overhead required to send packets across that interface | Optional. Integer. The cost of an interface is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of that interface. The larger the bandwidth, the smaller the cost. Valid values are 1-65535.
**mtuIgnore** | Ignore interface MTU setting | *true* or *false*.

### BGP Configuration

Parameter  |   Description  | Comments

**gracefulRestart**  | For packet forwarding to be uninterrupted during restart of services. | Optional.
**defaultOriginate**  | Allows the Edge Services Gateway to advertise itself as a default gateway to its peers. | Optional.  Default is *false*. Not allowed on a logical distributed router.
**localAS**  | The 2 byte local Autonomous System number that is assigned to the NSX Edge. The path of autonomous systems that a route traverses is used as one metric when selecting the best path to a destination.| Integer. A value (a globally unique number between 1-65535) for the local AS. This local AS is advertised when the NSX Edge peers with routers in other autonomous systems.  Either **localAS** or **localASNumber** is required. 
**localASNumber**  | The 2 or 4 byte local Autonomous System number that is assigned to the NSX Edge. The path of autonomous systems that a route traverses is used as one metric when selecting the best path to a destination. | Integer. A value (a globally unique number between 1-4294967295) for the Local AS. This local AS is advertised when the NSX Edge peers with routers in other autonomous systems.  Can be in plain or dotted format (e.g. 2 byte: 65001 or 0.65001, 4 byte: 65545 or 1.9). Either **localAS** or **localASNumber** is required. 
**bgpNeighbour > ipAddress**  | The IP address of the on-premises border device. | Required.  String. IPv4 only. IPv6 is not supported. Should not be the same as any of the NSX Edge interfaces's IPs, forwardingAddress, protocolAddress.
**bgpNeighbour > forwardingAddress** | The IP address of one of the uplink interfaces. | Logical (distributed) router only.
**bgpNeighbour > protocolAddress** | An IP address on the same subnet as the forwarding address. | Logical (distributed) router only.
**bgpNeighbour > remoteAS**  | The 2 byte remote Autonomous System number that is assigned to the the border device you are creating the connection for. | Integer. A value (a globally unique number between 1-65535) for the remote AS. Either **remoteAS** or **remoteASNumber** is required. 
**bgpNeighbour > remoteASNumber**  | The 2 or 4 byte remote Autonomous System number that is assigned to the border device you are creating the connection for. | Integer. A value (a globally unique number between 1-4294967295) for the remote AS. Can be in plain or dotted format (e.g. 2 byte: 65001 or 0.65001, 4 byte: 65545 or 1.9). Either **remoteAS** or **remoteASNumber** is required. 
**bgpNeighbour > removePrivateAS** | Determines whether to remove private AS number while redistributing routes. | Boolean. You can set to *true* only when remote and local AS are different.
**bgpNeighbour > weight**  | Weight for the neighbor connection | Optional. Integer. By default, weight is set to 60.
**bgpNeighbour > holdDownTimer**  | Interval for the hold down timer | Optional. Integer. The NSX Edge uses the standard, default values for the keep alive timer (60 seconds) and the hold down timer. The default value for the hold down timer is 3x keepalive or 180 seconds. Once peering between two neighbors is achieved, the NSX Edge  starts a hold down timer. Each keep alive message it receives from the neighbor resets the hold down timer to 0.  When the NSX Edge fails to receive three consecutive keep alive messages, so that the hold down timer reaches 180 seconds, the NSX Edge considers the neighbor down and deletes the routes from this neighbor. **Note:** The default time-to-live (TTL) value in the BGP packets that are sent to eBGP neighbors is 64. This value is not configurable.
**bgpNeighbour > keepAliveTimer**  | Interval for the keep alive timer. | Optional. Integer. Default is *60*. Valid values are 1-65534.
**bgpNeighbour > password**  | The authentication password. | Optional. String. Each segment sent on the connection between the neighbors is verified. MD5 authentication must be configured with the same password on both BGP neighbors, otherwise, the connection between them will not be made.
**bgpFilter > direction**  | Indicate whether you are filtering traffic to or from the neighbor | Optional. Choice of *in* or *out*.
**bgpFilter > action**  | Permit or deny traffic. | Optional. Choice of *permit* or *deny*.
**bgpFilter > network**  | The network that you want to filter to or from the neighbor. | CIDR format. IPv4 only. IPv6 is not supported.
**bgpFilter > ipPrefixGe**  | The IP prefixes that are to be filtered.  Filter prefixes greater than or equal to this value.  | Optional. Integer. Specify valid IPv4 prefixes.
**bgpFilter > ipPrefixLe**  | The IP prefixes that are to be filtered. Filter prefixes less than or equal to this value. | Optional. Integer. Specify valid IPv4 prefixes. 

**Note:** New parameters **localASNumber** and **remoteASNumber** have
been added in NSX 6.3.0 to allow configuration of 4 byte AS numbers.
The previous parameters, **localAS** and **remoteAS** are still valid.

When you configure BGP, you must provide a local AS number parameter
(**localAS** or **localASNumber**) and a remote AS number parameter
(**remoteAS** or **remoteASNumber**). If you provide both forms of
either local or remote AS number (for example, **localAS** and
**localASNumber**), the values must be the same.

You can use any combination of remote and local AS parameters, as long
as the values are valid. For example, **localAS** of *65501* and
**remoteASNumber** of *70000*.

If you configure a 2 byte number, both forms of the AS number
parameters are returned with a GET request (for example, **localAS**
and **localASNumber**). If you configure a 4 byte number, only the 4
byte parameter is returned (**localASNumber**).  

If both parameters are present (for example **localAS** and
**localASNumber**), and you update one parameter (**localAS**)
subsequent GET requests will show both parameters updated.  

### Multicast Configuration

Parameter  |   Description  | Comments

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/routing/config/static
Working With Static and Default Routes
----
Prior to NSX Data Center for vSphere 6.4.4, the maximum number of static routes
is limited to 2048 (2K) for all Edge appliance form factors.
Starting with NSX Data Center for vSphere 6.4.4, the maximum number of static
routes depends on the Edge appliance form factor.
However, for a Distributed Logical Router appliance, the maximum number of static routes
remains unchanged (2048) because the edge form factor is always *Compact*.

The following table shows the maximum number of permitted static routes for various 
Edge appliance form factors.

Edge Form Factor | Maximum Number of Static Routes
---|---

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/routing/config/ospf
Working With OSPF Routing for NSX Edge
----
NSX Edge supports OSPF, an interior gateway protocol that routes IP packets
only within a single routing domain. It gathers link state information from
available routers and constructs a topology map of the network.  The topology
determines the routing table presented to the Internet Layer, which makes
routing decisions based on the destination IP address found in IP packets.

OSPF routing policies provide a dynamic process of traffic load balancing
between routes of equal cost. An OSPF network is divided into routing areas to
optimize traffic. An area is a logical collection of OSPF networks, routers,
and links that have the same area identification.

Areas are identified by an Area ID.          

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve OSPF configuration.            

Note: **protocolAddress** and **forwardingAddress** are required
for Distributed Logical Router only. See *Working With the NSX

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/routing/config/bgp
Working With BGP Routes for NSX Edge
---
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) makes core routing decisions. It includes a table
of IP networks or prefixes which designate network reachability among
autonomous systems. An underlying connection between two BGP speakers is
established before any routing information is exchanged. Keep alive messages
are sent out by the BGP speakers in order to keep this relationship alive. Once
the connection is established, the BGP speakers exchange routes and synchronize
their tables.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve BGP configuration.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/loadbalancer/config
Working With NSX Edge Load Balancer
----

The NSX Edge load balancer enables network traffic to follow multiple
paths to a specific destination. It distributes incoming service
requests evenly among multiple servers in such a way that the load
distribution is transparent to users. Load balancing thus helps in
achieving optimal resource utilization, maximizing throughput,
minimizing response time, and avoiding overload. NSX Edge provides load
balancing up to Layer 7.

You map an external, or public, IP address to a set of internal servers
for load balancing. The load balancer accepts TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS
requests on the external IP address and decides which internal server
to use.  Port 8090 is the default listening port for TCP, port 80 is
the default port for HTTP, and port 443 is the default port for HTTPs.

* **get** *(secured)*: Get load balancer configuration.
* **put** *(secured)*: Configure load balancer.

The input contains five parts: application profile, virtual server,
pool, monitor and application rule.

For the data path to work, you need to add firewall rules to allow
required traffic as per the load balancer configuration.

**requests > queries** | Indicates all of the DNS queries the server received.
**requests > total** | Indicates all of the responses the server returned to requests. This might be different from the requests.total because some requests might be rejected. total = success + nxrrset + servFail + formErr + nxdomain + others.
**responses > success** | Indicates all of the successful DNS responses.
**responses > nxrrset** | Indicates the count of no existent resource record. 
**responses > servFail** | Indicates the count of the SERVFAIL responses.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/dhcp/config
Configure DHCP for NSX Edge
----
NSX Edge provides DHCP service to bind assigned IP addresses to MAC
addresses, helping to prevent MAC spoofing attacks. All virtual
machines protected by a NSX Edge can obtain IP addresses dynamically
from the NSX Edge DHCP service.

NSX Edge supports IP address pooling and one-to-one static IP address
allocation based on the vCenter managed object ID (vmId) and interface
ID (interfaceId) of the requesting client.

If either bindings or pools are not included in the PUT call, existing
bindings or pools are deleted.

If the NSX Edge autoConfiguration flag and autoConfigureDNS is true, and the
primaryNameServer or secondaryNameServer parameters are not specified, NSX
Manager applies the DNS settings to the DHCP configuration.

NSX Edge DHCP service adheres to the following rules:
* Listens on the NSX Edge internal interface (non-uplink interface)
for DHCP discovery.
* As stated above, vmId specifies the vc-moref-id of the virtual
machine, and vnicId specifies the index of the
vNic for the requesting client. The hostname is an identification of
the binding being created. This hostName is not pushed as the
specified host name of the virtual machine.
* By default, all clients use the IP address of the internal interface
of the NSX Edge as the default gateway address. To override it,
specify **defaultGateway** per binding or per pool. The client’s broadcast
and subnetMask values are from the internal interface for the
container network.
* **leaseTime** can be infinite, or a number of seconds. If not specified,
the default lease time is 1 day.
* Logging is disabled by default.
* Setting the parameter **enable** to *true* starts the DHCP service
while setting **enable** to *false* stops the service.  
* Both **staticBinding** and **ipPools** must be part of the PUT request body.
If either bindings or pools are not included in the PUT call, existing
bindings or pools are deleted.

**DHCP Configuration Parameters**

Parameter Name | Parameter Information 
------|-----
**enabled** | Default is true.
**staticBinding** | Assign an IP address via DHCP statically rather than dynamically. You can either specify **macAddress** directly, or specify **vmId** and **vnicId**. In case both are specified, only **macAddress** will be used; **vmId** and **vnicId** will be ignored.
**staticBinding > macAddress** | Optional.
**staticBinding > vmId** | Optional. The VM must be connected to the specified **vnicId**.
**staticBinding > vnicId** | Optional. Possible values 0 to 9.
**staticBinding > hostname** | Optional. Disallow duplicate.
**staticBinding > ipAddress** | The IP can either belong to a a subnet of one of Edge's vNics or it can be any valid IP address, but the IP must not overlap with any primary/secondary IP addresses associated with any of Edge's vNICs. If the IP does not belong to any Edge vNic subnets, you must ensure that the default gateway and subnetMask are configured via this API call.
**ipPool > ipRange** |  Required. The IP range can either fall entirely within one of the Edge vNIC subnets, or it can be a valid IP range outside any Edge subnets. The IP range, however, cannot contain an IP that is defined as a vNic primary secondary IP. If the range does not fall entirely within one of the Edge vNIC subnets, you must provide correct **subnetMask** and **defaultGateway**.
**defaultGateway**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Optional. If the ipRange (for ipPool) or assigned IP (for staticBinding) falls entirely within one of the Edge vNIC subnets, **defaultGateway** is set to the primary IP of the vNIC configured with the matching subnet.  Otherwise, you must provide the correct gateway IP. If an IP is not provided, the client host may not get default gateway IP from the DHCP server.
**subnetMask**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Optional. If not specified, and the the ipRange (for ipPool) or assigned IP (for staticBinding) belongs to an Edge vNic subnet, it is defaulted to the subnet mask of this vNic subnet. Otherwise, it is defaulted to a minimum subnet mask which is figured out with the IP range itself, e.g. the mask of range 192.168.5.2-192.168.5.20 is 255.255.255.224. You can edit this range, if required. <br>**Note:** If you do not specify a subnet mask when configuring DHCP, **subnetMask** is not included in the output of `GET /api/4.0/edges/{edgeId}/dhcp/config` or `GET /api/4.0/edges/{edgeId}/dhcp/config/bindings/{bindingID}`. You can run `show configuration dhcp` on the Edge VM CLI to view the subnet mask.
**domainName** <br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Optional.
**primaryNameServer**<br>**secondaryNameServer**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool)|  Optional. If **autoConfigureDNS** is *true*, the DNS primary/secondary IPs will be generated from DNS service (if configured).
**leaseTime**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Optional. In seconds, default is *86400*. Valid **leaseTime** is a valid number or *infinite*. 
**autoConfigureDns**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) |  Optional. Default is *true*. 
**nextServer**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Global TFTP server setting. If an IP pool or static binding has a TFTP server configured via **option66** or **option150**, that server will be used instead.
**dhcpOptions** <br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Optional.
**dhcpOptions > option121**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Add a static route.
**dhcpOptions > option121 > destinationSubnet**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Destination network, for example 1.1.1.4/30.
**dhcpOptions > option121 > router**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Router IP address.
**dhcpOptions > option66**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Hostname or IP address of a single TFTP server for this IP pool.
**dhcpOptions > option67**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Filename to be downloaded from TFTP server.
**dhcpOptions > option150**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | IP address of TFTP server.
**dhcpOptions > option150 > server**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Use to specify more than one TFTP server by IP address for this IP Pool.
**dhcpOptions > option26**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | MTU.
**dhcpOptions > other**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Add DHCP options other than 26, 66, 67, 121, 150.
**dhcpOptions > other > code**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | Use the DHCP option number only. For example, to specify dhcp option 80, enter *80*.
**dhcpOptions > other > value**<br>(staticBinding and ipPool) | The DHCP option value, in hex. For example, *2F766172*.
**logging** | Optional. Logging is disabled by default.
**logging > enable** |  Optional, default is *false*.
**logging > logLevel** | Optional, default is *info*.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/dhcp/config/relay
Working With DHCP Relays
----
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) relay enables you to leverage your
existing DHCP infrastructure from within NSX without any interruption to the
IP address management in your environment. DHCP messages are relayed from
virtual machine(s) to the designated DHCP server(s) in the physical world.
This enables IP addresses within NSX to continue to be in synch with IP
addresses in other environments. 

DHCP configuration is applied on the logical
router port and can list several DHCP servers. Requests are sent to all listed
servers. While relaying the DHCP request from the client, the relay adds a
Gateway IP Address to the request. The external DHCP server uses this gateway
address to match a pool and allocate an IP address for the request. The
gateway address must belong to a subnet of the NSX port on which the relay is
running. 

You can specify a different DHCP server for each logical switch and
can configure multiple DHCP servers on each logical router to provide support
for multiple IP domains. 

NOTE DHCP relay does not support overlapping IP address space (option 82). 

DHCP Relay and DHCP service cannot run on a
port/vNic at the same time. If a relay agent is configured on a port, a DHCP
pool cannot be configured on the subnet(s) of this port.  

Parameter | Comments
---|---
**relay**   |You can configure ipPool, static-binding and relay at the same time if there is not any overlap on vnic.

Working With DHCP Leases
----

* **get** *(secured)*: Get DHCP lease information.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/highavailability/config
Working With NSX Edge High Availability
----
High Availability (HA) ensures that a NSX Edge appliance is always
available on your virtualized network. You can enable HA either when
installing NSX Edge or on an installed NSX Edge instance.

If a single appliance is associated with NSX Edge, the appliance configuration
is cloned for the standby appliance. If two appliances are associated with NSX
Edge and one of them is deployed, this REST call deploys the remaining appliance
and push HA configuration to both. 

HA relies on an internal interface. If an
internal interface does not exist, this call will not deploy the secondary
appliance, or push HA config to appliance. The enabling of HA will be done once
an available internal interface is added. If the PUT call includes an empty 
&lt;highAvailability /&gt; or enabled=false, it acts as a DELETE call.

* **get** *(secured)*: Get high availability configuration.
* **put** *(secured)*: Configure high availability.

* **ipAddress** - Optional. A pair of ipAddresses with /30 subnet
  mandatory, one for each appliance. If provided, they must NOT
  overlap with any subnet defined on the Edge vNics. If not specified,
  a pair of IPs will be picked up from the reserved subnet,
  169.254.0.0/16.
* **declareDeadTime** Optional. The default is 6 seconds. 
* **enabled** - Optional. The default is set to true. The enabled flag
  will cause the HA appliance to be deployed or destroyed.

* **delete** *(secured)*: NSX Manager deletes the standby appliance and removes the HA config
from the active appliance. You can also delete the HA configuration by
using a PUT call with empty &lt;highAvailability /&gt; or with
&lt;highAvailability&gt;&lt;enabled&gt;false&lt;/enabled&gt;&lt;/highAvailability&gt;.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/l2t/config
Working with L2 VPN Over IPSec
-----
Starting with NSX 6.4.2, you can stretch your 
layer 2 networks between two sites with L2 VPN service over IPSec. 
Before configuring the L2 VPN service over IPSec, you must first create 
a route-based IPSec VPN tunnel. You then consume this route-based IPSec
VPN tunnel to create a L2 VPN tunnel between the two sites.

In NSX 6.4.2, you cannot create and edit route-based IPSec VPN tunnel by
using the vSphere Web Client. You must use the NSX Data Center for
vSphere REST APIs.

For a detailed workflow of configuring the L2 VPN service over IPSec,
see the *NSX Administration Guide*.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/ipsec/config
Working With IPSec VPN
-----
NSX Edge supports site-to-site IPSec VPN between an NSX Edge instance
and remote sites. NSX Edge supports certificate authentication,
preshared key mode, and IP unicast traffic between the NSX Edge instance 
and remote VPN sites. 

Starting with NSX 6.4.2, you can configure both 
policy-based IPSec VPN service and route-based IPSec VPN service. However, 
you can configure, manage, and edit route-based IPSec VPN parameters only 
by using REST APIs. 

### Policy-based IPSec VPN
In a policy-based IPSec VPN, you explicitly configure the subnets behind 
the NSX Edge on the local site that require secure and encrypted 
communication with the remote subnets on the peer site.

When the local IPSec VPN site originates traffic from unprotected local 
subnets to the protected remote subnets on the peer site, the traffic 
is dropped.

The local subnets behind an NSX Edge must have address ranges that do not
overlap with the IP addresses on the peer VPN site. 

If the local and remote peer across an IPSec VPN tunnel have overlapping
IP addresses, traffic forwarding across the tunnel might not be consistent.
 
### Route-based IPSec VPN
Route-based IPSec VPN is similar to Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) 
over IPSec, with the exception that no additional encapsulation is added
to the packet before applying IPSec processing.

In a route-based IPSec tunnel configuration, you must define a VTI with a 
private IP address on both the local and peer sites. 
Traffic from the local subnets is routed through the VTI to the peer subnets. 
Use a dynamic routing protocol, such as BGP, to route traffic through the 
IPSec tunnel. The dynamic routing protocol decides traffic from which local 
subnet is routed using the IPSec tunnel to the peer subnet.

**Note:** The VTI that you configure is a static VTI. Therefore, it 
cannot have more than one IP address. A good practice is to ensure that
the IP address of the VTI on both the local and peer sites are on the same subnet.

**Important:** In NSX 6.4.2 and later, static routing and OSPF 
dynamic routing through an IPSec tunnel is not supported.

For a detailed example of configuring a route-based IPSec VPN tunnel between 
an NSX Edge and a Cisco CSR 1000V Virtual Appliance, see the 
*NSX Administration Guide*.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/ipsec/statistics
Working With IPSec VPN Statistics
---

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve IPSec VPN statistics.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.4.0 | Method updated. New parameter **channelIkeVersion** added under **IkeStatus** section. New parameters **failureMessage**, **packetsOut**, **packetSentErrors**, **encryptionFailures**, **sequenceNumberOverFlowErrors**, **packetsIn**, **packetReceivedErrors**, **decryptionFailures**, **replayErrorsintegrityErrors** added under **tunnelStatus** section. New parameter **siteId** added.
6.4.2 | Method updated. Added **virtualTunnelInterfaceStats**, **globalPacketDropStatistics** and **ikeStatistics** sections in the API response. 

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/autoconfiguration
Automatic Configuration of Firewall Rules
----
If autoConfiguration is enabled, firewall rules are automatically
created to allow control traffic. Rules to allow data traffic are not
created.  For example, if you are using IPsec VPN, and
**autoConfiguration** is *true*, firewall rules will automatically be
configured to allow IKE traffic. However, you will need to add
additional rules to allow the data traffic for the IPsec tunnel. If HA
is enabled, firewall rules are always created, even if
**autoConfiguration** is *false*, otherwise both HA appliances will
become active.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve the auto configuration settings for the NSX Edge.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the auto configuration settings for the NSX Edge.

### /4.0/edges/{edgeId}/appliances
Working With NSX Edge Appliance Configuration
-----
See *Working With NSX Edge* for additional parameters used to configure appliances.

When you create an NSX Edge, you define parameters that determine how
the appliance is deployed, including **resourcePoolId**, **dataStoreId**,
**hostId**, and **vmFolderId**. After the appliance is deployed, these
deployment details may change, and the appliance parameters are updated
to reflect the current, live location.

You can view the originally configured parameters by using the
**configuredResourcePool**, **configuredDataStore**, **configuredHost**, and
**configuredVmFolder** parameters.

You can trigger a high availability failover on the active NSX Edge
appliance by changing the haAdminState value to *down* as part of
appliance configuration for an NSX Edge. The haAdminState parameter
determines whether or not an NSX Edge appliance is participating in
high availability. Both appliances in an NSX Edge high availability
configuration normally have an haAdminState of *up*. When you set the
haAdminState of the active appliance to be *down*, it stops
participating in high availability, and informs the standby appliance
of its status.  The standby appliance becomes active immediately.  

Parameter | Description | Comments
--------|-------------|---------
**highAvailabilityIndex** | Index number of the appliance | Read only.
**haAdminState** | Indicates whether appliance is participating in high availability. | If the active appliance **haAdminState** is set to *down*, it stops participating in HA, and informs the standby appliance of its status. The standby appliance becomes active immediately. 
**configuredResourcePool > id** | ID of resource pool on which NSX Edge was originally deployed. | Read only.
**configuredResourcePool > name** | Name of resource pool on which NSX Edge was originally deployed. | Read only.
**configuredResourcePool > isValid** | True if resource pool on which NSX Edge was originally deployed currently exists. | Read only. *true* or *false*.
**configuredDataStore > id** | ID of data store on which NSX Edge was originally deployed. | Read only.
**configuredDataStore > name** | Name of data store on which NSX Edge was originally deployed. | Read only.
**configuredDataStore > isValid** | True if resource pool on which NSX Edge was originally deployed currently exists. | Read only. *true* or *false*.
**configuredHost > id** | ID of host on which NSX Edge was originally deployed. | Read only.
**configuredHost > name** | Name of host on which NSX Edge was originally deployed. | Read only.
**configuredHost > isValid** | True if resource pool on which NSX Edge was originally deployed currently exists. | Read only. *true* or *false*.
**configuredVmFolder > id** | ID of folder in which NSX Edge was originally deployed. | Read only.
**configuredVmFolder > name** | Name of folder in which NSX Edge was originally deployed. | Read only.
**configuredVmFolder > isValid** | True if resource pool on which NSX Edge was originally deployed currently exists. | Read only. *true* or *false*.

* **post** *(secured)*: * Use the *size* query parameter to change the form factor of the Edge appliance.
* Use the *action* query parameter to reset the CPU and memory reservation of the Edge appliance to **System Managed** resource reservation.

**Note:** Do not combine the *size* and *action* query parameters in a single API request by using an ampersand (&).
In other words, run the API requests independently with a single query parameter.

**Method history:**

Release | Modification
--------|-------------
6.4.4 | Method updated. Added **action** query parameter. 

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve appliance configuration.

### /4.0/edges/jobs
Configuring Edge Services in Async Mode
----
You can configure NSX Edge to work in async mode. In the async mode, accepted
commands return an Accepted status and a taskId. To know the status of
the task, you can check the status of that taskId.  The advantage of the
async mode is that APIs are returned very fast and actions like vm
deployment, reboots, publish to NSX Edge appliance, are done behind the
scene under the taskId .  To configure async mode, ?async=true at the end
of any 4.0 service configuration URL for POST, PUT, and DELETE calls.
Without async mode, the location header in HTTP response has the resource
ID whereas in async mode, location header has the job ID.

The job status response includes the job status (*SUCCESS*, *FAILED*,
*QUEUED*, *RUNNING*, *ROLLBACK*), URI of the resource, and ID of the
resource. 

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve NSX Edge job status.

### /4.0/edges/jobs/{jobId}

=========

### /4.0/edgePublish/tuningConfiguration
Working With NSX Edge Tuning Configuration
------

Starting in 6.2.3 you can configure default values for NSX Edge
configuration parameters, including publishing and health check
timeouts, and CPU and memory reservation, which are applicable to all
NSX Edges.  The values for the tuning configuration parameters have been
set to sensible defaults and may not require any changes. However, based
on datacenter capacity and requirements, you can change the default CPU
and memory resource reservation percentages using this API.  This
percentage is applied across all Edge VM Sizes {COMPACT, LARGE,
QUADLARGE, XLARGE}.
The default values are:
* 100% for CPU reservation
* 100% for Memory reservation
* 1000 MHz per CPU

| Name | Comments |
|------|----------|
| lockUpdatesOnEdge | Default value is false. Serialize specific Edge operations related to DHCP and vnic configuration to avoid concurrency errors when too many configuration change requests arrive at the same time.|
| aggregatePublishing | Default value is true (enabled). Speed up configuration change publishing to the NSX Edge by aggregating over the configuration versions.|
| edgeVMHealthCheckIntervalInMin | Default value for time interval between NSX Edge VM's health check is 0, where NSX Manager manages the interval based on the number of NSX Edge VM's. A positive integer value overrides the default behavior.|
| healthCheckCommandTimeoutInMs | Default timeout value for health check command is 120000.|
| maxParallelVixCallsForHealthCheck | The maximum concurrent health check calls that can be made for NSX Edge VM's based on VIX communication channel is 25.|
| publishingTimeoutInMs | The timeout value to publish a configuration change on NSX Edge appliance.  Default is 1200000 (20 minutes).|
| edgeVCpuReservationPercentage | Integer value [0-100], specifying the CPU reservation percentage which will be applied to the NSX Edge appliance. To disable this resource reservation, enter 0. |
| edgeMemoryReservationPercentage | integer value [0-100], specifying the memory reservation percentage which will be applied to the NSX Edge appliance. To disable this resource reservation, enter 0. |

## policy
Working With Service Composer
============================
Service Composer helps you provision and assign network and security
services to applications in a virtual infrastructure. You map these services
to a security group, and the services are applied to the virtual machines in
the security group.

## Security Groups

You begin by creating a security group to define assets that you want to
protect. Security groups may be static (including specific virtual machines)
or dynamic where membership may be defined in one or more of the following
ways:
* vCenter containers (clusters, port groups, or datacenters).
* Security tags, IPset, MACset, or even other security groups. For example,
  you may include a criteria to add all members tagged with the specified
  security tag (such as AntiVirus.virusFound) to the security group.
* Directory Groups (if NSX Manager is registered with Active Directory).
* Regular expressions such as virtual machines with name *VM1*.

Note that security group membership changes constantly. For example, a
virtual machine tagged with the AntiVirus.virusFound tag is moved into the
Quarantine security group. When the virus is cleaned and this tag is removed
from the virtual machine, it again moves out of the Quarantine security
group.

## Security Policies

A security policy is a collection of the following service configurations.

Service | Description | Applies to
---|---|---
Distributed Firewall rules<br>**category**: *firewall* |  Rules that define the traffic to be allowed to, from, or within the security group. | vNIC
Guest Introspection service<br>**category**: *endpoint* | Third party solution provider services such as anti-virus or vulnerability management services. | virtual machines
Network Introspection services <br>(NetX or Network Extensibility)<br>**category**: *traffic_steering*| Services that monitor your network such as IPS. | virtual machines

## Applying Security Policies to Security Groups

You apply a security policy (say SP1) to a security group (say SG1). The
services configured for SP1 are applied to all virtual machines that are
members of SG1. If a virtual machine belongs to more than one security
group, the services that are applied to the virtual machine depends on the
precedence of the security policy mapped to the security groups. Service
Composer profiles can be exported and imported as backups or for use in
other environments. This approach to managing network and security services
helps you with actionable and repeatable security policy management.

## Service Composer Parameters

The following parameters are related to Service Composer, security
policies, and security groups.
  
### Common Parameters

* **actionType** - Defines the type of action belonging to a given
executionOrderCategory
* **executionOrderCategory** - Category to which the action belongs to
(endpoint, firewall or traffic_steering)
* **isActive** - In a security policy hierarchy, an action within a policy
may or may not be active based on the
precedence of the policy or usage of isActionEnforced flag in that
hierarchy
* **isActionEnforced** - Enforces an action of a parent policy on its
child policies for a given actionType and
executionOrderCategory. Note that in a policy hierarchy, for a given
actionType and executionOrderCategory, there can be only one action
which can be marked as enforced.
* **isEnabled** - Indicates whether an action is enabled
* **secondarySecurityGroup** - Applicable for actions which need secondary
security groups, say a source-destination firewall rule
* **securityPolicy** - Parent policy in an action

### Output-only Parameters

* **executionOrder** - Defines the sequence in which actions belonging to
an executionOrderCategory are executed. Note that this is not an input
parameter and its value is implied by the index in the list.

### Firewall Category Parameters

* **action** - Allow or block the traffic
* **applications** - Applications / application groups on which the rules
are to be applied
* **direction** - Direction of traffic towards primary security group.
Possible values: inbound, outbound, intra
* **logged** - Flag to enable logging of the traffic that is hit by this
rule
* **outsideSecondaryContainer** - Flag to specify outside i.e. outside
securitygroup-3

### Endpoint Category Parameters

* **serviceId** - ID of the service (as registered with the service
insertion module). If this tag is null, the
functionality type (as defined in actionType tag) is not applied which
will also result in blocking the actions (of given functionality type)
that are inherited from the parent security policy. This is true if
there is no action of enforce type.
* **invalidServiceId** - Flag to indicate that the service that was
referenced in this rule is deleted, which make
the rule ineffective (or deviate from the original intent that existed
while configuring the rule). You must either modify this rule by
adding correct Service or delete this rule.
* **serviceName** -Name of the service
* **serviceProfile** - Profile to be referenced in Endpoint rule.
* **invalidServiceProfile** - Flag to indicate that the service profile
that was referenced in this rule is deleted, which makes
the rule ineffective (or deviate from the original intent that existed
while configuring the rule). You must either modify this rule by
adding correct Service Profile or delete this rule.

The following parameters are deprecated:
* **vendorTemplateId**
* **invalidVendorTemplateId**
* **vendorTemplateName**

### Traffic Steering/NetX Category Parameters

* **redirect** - Flag to indicate whether to redirect the traffic or not
* **serviceProfile** - Service profile for which redirection is being
configured
* **logged** - Flag to enable logging of the traffic that is hit by this
rule

### /2.0/services/policy/securitypolicy
Working With Security Policies
------------------------------
A security policy is a set of Endpoint, firewall, and network
introspection services that can be applied to a security group.

See *Working With Security Groups* for more information about managing
security groups.

* **post** *(secured)*: Create a security policy.

When creating a security policy, a parent security policy can be
specified if required. The security policy inherits services from the
parent security policy. Security group bindings and actions can also
be specified while creating the policy. Note that execution order of
actions in a category is implied by their order in the list. The
response of the call has Location header populated with the URI using
which the created object can be fetched.

Ensure that:
* the required VMware built in services (such as Distributed Firewall
  and Endpoint) are installed. See *NSX Installation Guide*.
* the required partner services have been registered with NSX Manager.
* the required security groups have been created.

### /2.0/services/policy/securitypolicy/serviceprovider/firewall
Working With Service Composer Firewall Applied To Setting
-------------
You can set the applied to setting for all firewall rules created
though Service Composer to either Distributed Firewall or Policy's
Security Groups. By default, the applied to is set to Distributed
Firewall. When Service Composer firewall rules have an applied to
setting of distributed firewall, the rules are applied to all clusters
on which distributed firewall is installed. If the firewall rules are
set to apply to the policy's security groups, you have more granular
control over the firewall rules, but may need multiple security
policies or firewall rules to get the desired result.

**Applied To Values for Service Composer Firewall Rules**

Value | Description
------|----------
dfw_only | Firewall rules are applied to all clusters on which Distributed Firewall is installed.
policy_security_group | Firewall rules are applied to security groups on which the security policy is applied.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve the Service Composer firewall applied to setting.

* **put** *(secured)*: Update the Service Composer firewall applied to setting.

### /2.0/services/policy/securitypolicy/hierarchy
Working With Service Composer Configuration Import and Export
-----

* **post** *(secured)*: Import a security policy configuration

You can create multiple security policies and parent-child
hierarchies using the data fetched through export. All objects
including security policies, security groups and security actions
are created on a global scope.

The policy that is being imported needs to be included in the
request body.

If a suffix is specified, it is added after the names of the
security policy, security action, and security group objects in the
exported XML. The suffix can thus be used to differentiate locally
created objects from imported ones.

The location of the newly created security policy objects (multiple
locations are separated by commas) is populated in the Location
header of the response.

* **get** *(secured)*: Export a Service Composer configuration (along with the
security groups to which the security policies are mapped).
You can save the response to a file.  The saved configuration can be
used as a backup for situations where you may accidentally delete a
policy configuration, or it can be exported for use in another NSX
Manager environment.

If a prefix is specified, it is added before the names of the
security policy, security action, and security group objects in the
exported XML. The prefix can thus be used to indicate the remote
source from where the hierarchy was exported.

### /2.0/services/policy/securityaction/{category}/virtualmachines

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve all security actions applicable on a security group for all
ExecutionOrderCategories. The list is sorted based on the weight of
security actions in descending order.  The **isActive** tag indicates
if a securityaction will be applied (by the enforcement engine) on the
security group.

### /2.0/services/policy/virtualmachine/{ID}/securityactions
Working With Security Actions Applicable on a Virtual Machine
----

* **get** *(secured)*: You can retrieve the security actions applicable on a virtual machine for
all ExecutionOrderCategories. The list of SecurityActions per
ExecutionOrderCategory is sorted based on the weight of security actions
in descending order. The **isActive** tag indicates whether a security
action will be applied (by the enforcement engine) on the virtual
machine.

### /2.0/services/policy/serviceprovider/firewall

status. It keeps track of the latest heartbeat from each host.  When
querying a host’s connection status, NSX Manager will get the latest
heartbeat information to compare the last heartbeat time and current time.
If the duration is longer than a threshold, it returns *DOWN*, otherwise
it returns *UP*. If no last heartbeat information is found and this host
has not been prepared or the netcpa version on this host is lower than
6.2.0, it will return *NOT_AVAILABLE*.  But if no last heartbeat
information is found and the host has been prepared with netcpa version no
less than 6.2.0, it will return *DOWN*. When a host has been unprepared,
its heartbeat information will be removed from the NSX Manager memory.

* **get** *(secured)*: Retrieve the status of the specified host.
