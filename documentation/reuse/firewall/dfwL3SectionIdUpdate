Update the specified layer 3 section in distributed firewall.

* Retrieve the configuration for the specified section.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the Etag value, and submit the request.
* Starting in NSX 6.4.5, the Etag value returned in the response header of the 
  GET API request contains double quotes. You must strip off the double quotes 
  before using the Etag value in the If-Match header. If you are using the PUT API
  request in an automation script, ensure that the script strips off the double 
  quotes in the Etag value.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,
if an IP set is referenced in the rule only IPSet and Type is needed in the
Source/Destination objects and not Name and isValid tags.

When updating the firewall configuration:
* IDs for new objects (rule/section) should be removed or set to zero.
* If new entities (sections/rules) have been sent in the request, the response
  will contain the system-generated IDs, which are assigned to these new
  entities.
* **appliedTo** can be any valid firewall rule element.
* **action** can be *ALLOW*, *BLOCK*, or *REJECT*. REJECT sends reject message for
  unaccepted packets; RST packets are sent for TCP connections and ICMP
  unreachable code packets are sent for UDP, ICMP, and other IP connections
* source and destination can have an exclude flag. For example, if you add an
  exclude tag for 1.1.1.1 in the source parameter, the rule looks for traffic
  originating from all IPs other than 1.1.1.1.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall
sections created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute
in the XML called managedBy. You should not modify Service Composer
firewall sections using Distributed Firewall REST APIs. If you do, you
must synchronize firewall rules from Service Composer using the `GET
/api/2.0/services/policy/serviceprovider/firewall` API.
