Update the specified layer 2 section in distributed firewall.

* Retrieve the configuration for the specified section.
* Retrieve the Etag value from the response headers.
* Extract and modify the configuration from the response body as needed.
* Set the If-Match header to the Etag value, and submit the request.

Not all fields are required while sending the request. All the optional fields
are safe to be ignored while sending the configuration to server. For example,
if an IP set is referenced in the rule only IPSet and Type is needed in the
Source/Destination objects and not Name and isValid tags.

When updating the firewall configuration:
* IDs for new objects (rule/section) should be removed or set to zero.
* If new entities (sections/rules) have been sent in the request, the response
  will contain the system-generated IDs, which are assigned to these new
  entities.
* **appliedTo** can be any valid firewall rule element.
* **action** can be *ALLOW*, *BLOCK*, or *REJECT*. REJECT sends reject message for
  unaccepted packets; RST packets are sent for TCP connections and ICMP
  unreachable code packets are sent for UDP, ICMP, and other IP connections
* source and destination can have an exclude flag. For example, if you add an
  exclude tag for 1.1.1.1 in the source parameter, the rule looks for traffic
  originating from all IPs other than 1.1.1.1.

When Distributed Firewall is used with Service Composer, firewall
sections created by Service Composer contain an additional attribute
in the XML called managedBy. You should not modify Service Composer
firewall sections using Distributed Firewall REST APIs. If you do, you
must synchronize firewall rules from Service Composer using the `GET
/api/2.0/services/policy/serviceprovider/firewall` API.
